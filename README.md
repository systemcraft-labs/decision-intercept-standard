# Decision Intercept™ Standard

## One-Paragraph Definition (Press / Enterprise / Research)

**Decision Intercept™** is a global standard designed to introduce an explicit moment of human responsibility immediately before irreversible actions are executed.  
It is not designed to block, enforce, or surveil decisions; rather, it provides a clear confirmation point at the final possible moment of execution.  
Decision Intercept exists to clarify responsibility—not to impose control—ensuring that human judgment remains present within accelerated and automated systems.

## What is Decision Intercept™

Decision Intercept™ is a system standard designed to operate immediately before an irreversible action is executed.

An **irreversible action** is any action that, once performed, cannot be fully undone without cost, harm, or a transfer of responsibility.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Sending an email or message  
- Executing a payment  
- Publishing content  
- Signing a contract  
- Triggering automated or AI-driven actions  

Decision Intercept™ does not block, censor, or indefinitely delay human actions.

Instead, it introduces a **clear and explicit confirmation moment** at the final possible point where responsibility can be consciously acknowledged by a human actor.

## Core Principles

- **Systems do not decide. Humans decide explicitly.**
- **Fail-open by design.** No action is permanently blocked by default.
- **No surveillance.** No behavioral profiling, hidden enforcement, or monitoring.
- **Clarity over control.** The objective is not prevention, but responsibility attribution.

---

## Purpose

As systems accelerate and irreversible actions become easier to trigger,  
human judgment is increasingly compressed into milliseconds.

Decision Intercept™ exists to ensure that **speed does not eliminate responsibility**.

This standard defines where human judgment should be explicitly recognized—  
not by coercion, but by intentional acknowledgment.

---

## Individual Use Charter

Decision Intercept™ remains freely available for permanent individual use.

This is not a pricing strategy.  
It is a **structural guarantee**.

- No advertising  
- No behavioral data monetization  
- No future paywalls for individual users  

Monetization, where applicable, is limited to organizational or domain-level contexts.

This principle is **designed as non-reversible**.

## Founder Role Definition

The Founder is defined as the originator and steward of the Decision Intercept™ standard.

This role is not defined by operational execution, but by responsibility for:
- Definition authority  
- Principle preservation  
- Boundary protection  

These roles exist to ensure continuity and integrity of the original definition and are structurally separated from implementation or deployment activities.

---

## Capital Principles

This standard is defined independently of capital structures.

Financial participation, where present, does not imply authority to redefine, reinterpret, or override the core definition of Decision Intercept™.

- Revenue does not precede responsibility  
- Scale does not precede control clarity  
- Neutrality precedes growth  

Mandatory monetization of individual users is explicitly excluded by design.

---

## Global-First Positioning

Decision Intercept™ is designed as a global action standard.

- Primary language: English  
- Korea functions as an initial validation environment, not a boundary  
- The standard is designed to operate across legal systems, cultures, and platforms
