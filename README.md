# Decision Intercept™ Standard

## One-Paragraph Definition (For Press / Enterprise / Research)

**Decision Intercept™** is a global standard designed to introduce an explicit moment of human responsibility immediately before irreversible actions are executed.  
It does not block, enforce, or surveil decisions; instead, it provides a clear confirmation point at the final possible moment.  
Decision Intercept exists to clarify responsibility—not to impose control—ensuring that human judgment remains present in accelerated and automated systems.

## What is Decision Intercept

Decision Intercept is a system standard designed to operate **immediately before irreversible actions**.

An irreversible action is any action that, once executed, cannot be fully undone without cost, harm, or responsibility transfer.

Examples include but are not limited to:
- Sending an email or message
- Executing a payment
- Publishing content
- Signing a contract
- Triggering automated or AI-driven actions

Decision Intercept does not block, censor, override, or indefinitely delay human actions.

Instead, it introduces a **clear and explicit moment of confirmation** at the final possible point —  
where responsibility can still be consciously owned by the human actor.

---

## Core Principles

- **The system does not decide.**  
  The human decides — explicitly.

- **Fail-open by design.**  
  No action is permanently blocked by default.

- **No surveillance.**  
  No behavioral profiling, no hidden enforcement.

- **Responsibility clarity over control.**  
  The goal is not prevention, but accountability.

---

## Purpose

As systems accelerate and irreversible actions become easier to trigger,  
human judgment is increasingly compressed into milliseconds.

Decision Intercept exists to ensure that speed does not eliminate responsibility.

This standard defines **where human judgment must be acknowledged** —  
not by force, but by design.

---

## Personal Free Use Charter

Decision Intercept shall remain **permanently free for individual personal use**.

This is not a pricing strategy.  
It is a structural guarantee.

- No advertisements  
- No behavioral data monetization  
- No future paywalls for personal users  

Monetization applies **only** at the organizational or domain level.

This principle is irrevocable.

## Founder Role Definition

The Founder is the originator and custodian of the Decision Intercept standard.

The Founder is not defined by operational execution, but by:
- Definition authority
- Principle preservation
- Boundary protection

Titles include:
- Founder
- Architect
- Standard Custodian

These authorities are non-delegable.

---

## Capital Principles

Capital exists to support the standard — not to redefine it.

- Revenue precedes valuation
- Control precedes scale
- Neutrality precedes growth

Forced monetization of personal users is prohibited.

---

## Global-First Positioning

Decision Intercept is a global behavioral standard.

- Primary language: English
- Korea is an initial validation environment, not a boundary

The standard is designed to operate across legal systems, cultures, and platforms.
