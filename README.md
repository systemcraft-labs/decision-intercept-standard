## One-Paragraph Definition (Press / Enterprise / Research)

**Decision Intercept™** is a global action standard designed to introduce an explicit moment of human responsibility immediately before an irreversible action is executed.

It does not block, enforce, surveil, or evaluate decisions. Instead, it provides a clear and intentional confirmation point at the final possible moment of execution.

Decision Intercept™ exists to clarify responsibility—not to impose control—ensuring that human judgment remains consciously present within accelerated, automated, and AI-assisted systems.

## What is Decision Intercept™

Decision Intercept™ is a system standard designed to operate immediately before an irreversible action is executed.

An **irreversible action** is defined as any action that, once performed, cannot be fully undone without cost, harm, or a transfer of responsibility.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Sending an email or message  
- Executing a payment  
- Publishing content  
- Signing a contract  
- Triggering automated or AI-driven actions  

Decision Intercept™ does **not** block, censor, delay indefinitely, or override human actions.

Instead, it introduces a clear and explicit confirmation moment at the final possible point where responsibility can still be consciously acknowledged by a human actor.

---

## Core Principles

- Systems do not decide. Humans decide explicitly.  
- Fail-open by design. No action is permanently blocked by default.  
- No surveillance. No behavioral profiling, monitoring, or hidden enforcement.  
- Clarity over control. The objective is not prevention, but responsibility attribution.

---

## Purpose

As systems accelerate and irreversible actions become easier to trigger,  
human judgment is increasingly compressed into milliseconds.

Decision Intercept™ exists to ensure that speed does not eliminate responsibility.

This standard defines where human judgment should be explicitly recognized—
not by coercion, enforcement, or policy, but by intentional acknowledgment.

---

## Individual Use Charter

Decision Intercept™ remains freely available for permanent individual use.

This is not a pricing strategy.  
It is a structural guarantee.

- No advertising  
- No behavioral data monetization  
- No future paywalls for individual users  

Monetization, where applicable, is strictly limited to organizational, enterprise, or domain-level contexts.

This principle is defined as **non-reversible**.

---

## Founder Role Definition

The Founder is defined as the original author and long-term steward of the Decision Intercept™ standard.

This role is not defined by implementation, deployment, or commercial operation, but by responsibility for:

- Definition authority  
- Principle preservation  
- Boundary protection  

These responsibilities exist to ensure continuity and integrity of the original definition and are structurally separated from any specific implementation, product, or commercial entity.

---

## Capital Principles

Decision Intercept™ is defined independently of capital structures.

Financial participation, sponsorship, licensing, or adoption does **not** imply authority to redefine, reinterpret, supersede, or override the core definition of the standard.

- Revenue does not precede responsibility  
- Scale does not precede clarity  
- Neutrality precedes growth  

Mandatory monetization of individual users is explicitly excluded by design.

---

## Global-First Positioning

Decision Intercept™ is designed as a global action standard.

- Primary language: English  
- Korea functions as an initial validation environment, not a boundary  
- The standard is designed to operate across legal systems, cultures, and platforms
