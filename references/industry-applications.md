# Decision Intercept™ Industry Application Reference

## Purpose
This document provides non-prescriptive, illustrative references for how the
Decision Intercept™ standard may be applied across different industries.

It does not mandate implementation methods, UI patterns, or enforcement mechanisms.
It exists solely as a contextual reference.

---

## General Principle
Across industries, Decision Intercept™ functions as a structural moment of
human responsibility immediately before an irreversible action is executed.

The action itself remains optional.
The responsibility remains human.
The system remains non-coercive.

---

## Financial Services
**Examples of irreversible actions:**
- Executing payments or transfers
- Approving high-risk transactions
- Final submission of trading orders

**Reference usage:**
Decision Intercept™ may be referenced as a final human acknowledgment point
prior to execution, clarifying responsibility without delaying or blocking execution.

---

## Healthcare & Medical Systems
**Examples of irreversible actions:**
- Finalizing treatment decisions
- Confirming medication orders
- Submitting diagnostic conclusions

**Reference usage:**
Decision Intercept™ may be cited as an explicit awareness moment
before actions that carry irreversible patient impact.

## AI & Automated Systems
**Examples of irreversible actions:**

- Publishing AI-generated outputs
- Initiating irreversible automated workflows

**Reference usage:**
Decision Intercept™ may be referenced as a human-in-the-loop responsibility boundary,
without evaluating, approving, or scoring the decision itself.

## What This Reference Is Not
- This document does not define compliance requirements.
- It does not certify implementations.
- It does not guarantee legal protection.
