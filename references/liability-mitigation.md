# Decision Intercept™ as a Liability Mitigation Reference


## Scope
This document describes how the Decision Intercept™ standard may be referenced
in organizational, legal, and risk management contexts.
It does not prescribe implementation details.

## What Decision Intercept™ Is Not
Decision Intercept™ does not block actions, enforce decisions, or monitor user behavior.
It does not alter responsibility allocation or transfer liability.

## Responsibility Clarification
Decision Intercept™ introduces an explicit moment of human awareness
immediately before an irreversible action is executed.
The decision outcome remains the responsibility of the acting individual or organization.

## Risk and Due Diligence Context
In certain contexts, Decision Intercept™ may be referenced as evidence that
a system provided a reasonable opportunity for human judgment
prior to irreversible execution.

## Limitations
This reference does not constitute legal advice
and does not guarantee liability protection.
